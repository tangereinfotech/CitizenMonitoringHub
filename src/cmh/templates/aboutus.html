<p><b>{% trans "Background:" %}</b></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{% trans "The Government of India's ambitious development targets in the 11th Five Year Plan, and the Approach Paper to the 12th Five Year Plan focus on social inclusion for the most disadvantaged. While a number of policies and flagship programmes are in place to achieve MDGs, there is a need for more efficient, accountable and transparent delivery of services." %}</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{% trans "Given such urgency to meet MDGs for all sections of population, it is crucial that citizens, who are the primary beneficiaries, play an active role in assessing and giving feedback about the delivery of the services in claiming their entitlements under various programmes. In this context, multiple stakeholders have started a new initiative on amplifying citizens  voices for accountable governance." %}</p>
<p><b>{% trans "What is SAMADHAN?" %} </b></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{% trans "The initiative, entitled  SAMADHAN   Citizen s Action for Governance , is designed to provide real-time, authentic and reliable feedback from citizens on service delivery  under various flagship programmes of central and State Governments. These demands will be aggregated and amplified so that they trigger appropriate responses from service providers as well as provide useful data for policy and decision makers. In collaboration with State and District administrations several key stakeholders including  civil society groups, media, technology providers, and elected representatives have come together for this initiative, which is based on the use of communication technology to send and receive feedback on services in real time." %}</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{% trans "The overall objective of the initiative is to improve the quality of service delivery at local level by strengthening citizens and civil society capacity to enhance accountability and increase demand for services through use of ICT tools and knowledge." %}</p>
<p><b>{% trans "How does the SAMADHAN Platform Work?" %}</b></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{% trans "The SAMADHAN platform is an Internet-based software that collects citizens  voices on the performance and delivery of various public services and presents them for action and response by the relevant ministry or line department. After the government s action is taken, a message is sent to the citizen requesting them to verify that the action has taken place. Apart from collating information about individual services and feedback mechanisms, the Samadhan system allows for an in-depth analysis by civil society organisations and government so that systemic problems can be identified and addressed. Samadhan is being integrated with existing feedback and grievance redressal mechanisms in order to establish it as a unified gateway for information needed for speedy redressal. The information about complaints is available to the public, including CSOs, media etc. in an easy-to-use fashion. View the Demo Page for more details." %}</p>
