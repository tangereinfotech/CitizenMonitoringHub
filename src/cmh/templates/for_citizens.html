    <h4>{% trans "What is SAMADHAN and what can you do with it?" %}</h4>
    {% trans "The Government of India has in place a number of policies and flagship programmes to reduce poverty and inequality and provide quality education, health services and infrastructure and other essential services to improve people’s lives. On the other hand, citizens who are the primary beneficiaries of those policies and programmes need to play an active role in assessing and giving feedback about the delivery of the services and report to relevant authorities if those services are not forthcoming. Such participation by citizens in monitoring and claiming the government services will lead to more efficient, accountable and transparent delivery of services." %}<br/><br/>
    {% trans "SAMADHAN is an internet-based platform primarily for citizens to directly demand and track their service entitlements under national and state government schemes. Your NREGA wage has not been fully paid, a mother has not received her Janani Suraksha Yojana money, an Anganwaadi worker is not opening the nutrition center everyday - citizens can take any such problem they are facing and send a simple text message, call in at a toll-free number or visit the District Collector’s Office to demand or file complaints through SAMADHAN. Once demands or complaints are registered, local administration will process the complaints and respond with appropriate action to resolve them. Citizens can track the status of their complaint through a tracking number assigned to their individual case. After the government has taken action, a message is sent to the citizen requesting them to verify that the action has taken place. The reports are then mapped on the Samadhan site for public viewing." %}<br/><br/>
